Since the interface update of the RNC website happened, rusrime is no longer working. Currently, I have no plans to update it.

# rusrime
Rusrime is a rhyme searching tool for the Russian National Corpus. The program returns rhymes for a specific word. The results of a search for any poem are based on a poem's rhyme formula marked in the RNC. Note, that the Rusrime doesn't analyse poems with irregular and blended rhyme types.

Rusrime is powered with Pyscript and intended to be run in a browser. [Try it yourself](https://esbudylin.github.io/rusrime/).
